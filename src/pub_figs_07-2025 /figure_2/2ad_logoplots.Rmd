# Parameters for generating logo plots using LANL Analyze Align tool

## Input: 
  - Upload alignment of env amino acid sequences for one participant (all timepoints) with HXB2 reference sequence\
      - Names of sequences start with "timept."\
  - Sequence type: Amino Acid\
  - Positions/range to analyze: 325, 334, 336\
  - Rnage numbers refer to: Residues of HXB2\
  - Group the sequences: Report separate results for subsets of sequences\
      - Group sequences by: the characters in field 1 of names delimited by .\
  - Logo options\
      - Defaults\
      - Color scheme: Paste/upload predefined scheme\
        - Upload reference sheet of previously characterized resistance/sensitive mutations gathered from Bricault et al (red = resistant, blue = sensitive)\
        - Mutation | Color |\
      - Remove symbols from logo: resigues of 1st seq of alignment (HXB2)\
      - Potential N-linked glycosolation sites (Mark)}
